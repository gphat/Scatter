Scatter

Scatter is an experimental web framework inspired by Perl's Catalyst[0].  It is
also a project I am using to learn Scala.

Internals

Scatter uses a ServletContextListener (com.coldhardcode.scatter.ServletListener)
to populate a Dispatcher (com.coldhardcode.scatter.Dispatcher). It populates
the dispatcher with classes and method names identified by special annotations
using annovention[1].

The Scatter servlet (currently com.coldhardcode.scatter.Scatter) then uses
the dispatcher to fire the requested method, passing it a Context
(com.coldhardcode.scatter.Context) object. Last, a JSP view is instantiated
and it's process method is called with the context as the argument.

This entire codebase is sloppy and naive.  I hope to grow it to be less bad and
have more features.

You can create a WAR file using "sbt package"
